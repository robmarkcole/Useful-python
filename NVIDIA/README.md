## OpenDataCam
* Run object tracking & counting app on Jetson
* https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam
* yolov4 run at ~1-2 FPS on Jetson Nano
* To track vehicles need 8-9 FPS which cannot be performed on Nano and a Javier is required
* Write up with logging to influxDB and edge deployment with 4G sim -> https://www.hologram.io/blog/using-nvidia-jetson-and-opendatacam
* Can deploy with balena
* Uses openCV to access IP cam streams

## In production
