## Time series
TLDR: understand whether there is autocorrelation or not, mean is changing with time, and variance with time, then employ appropriate feature engineering

## Prophet
* [Library from Facebook](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html)
* I remember many headaches getting this setup. Use a conda env. Have fun.
* Compared to ARIMA:
  * Fast: with the time to build one ARIMA model I can run several Prophet models
  * Accuracy: it is accurate enough for quick analytical tasks that donâ€™t require high accuracy
  * Simple: it is very simple to use and configure, making the entire experience better

## Concepts
* Autocorrelation: also known as serial correlation, is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay.
* correlogram: is an image of correlation statistics, an ACF plot
