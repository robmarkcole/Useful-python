## General notes on cloud providers
* AWS & Azure are biggest, GCP quite a bit smaller, consider how difficult it will be to hire experienced people
* By far simpler to stay on a single cloud, there is always a cost to going multi-cloud, must be driven by business need
* Start with the simplest possible architecture
* Going overboard with security is a premature optimisation
* Even simple auth methods can be made pretty secure, e.g. throttling password attempts on SSH
* Terraform is popular, might be mixed with Cloudformation
