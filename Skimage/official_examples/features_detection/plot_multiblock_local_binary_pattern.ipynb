        "\n# Multi-Block Local Binary Pattern for texture classification\n\n\nThis example shows how to compute multi-block local binary pattern (MB-LBP)\nfeatures as well as how to visualize them.\n\nThe features are calculated similarly to local binary patterns (LBPs), except\nthat summed blocks are used instead of individual pixel values.\n\nMB-LBP is an extension of LBP that can be computed on multiple scales in\nconstant time using the integral image. 9 equally-sized rectangles are used to\ncompute a feature. For each rectangle, the sum of the pixel intensities is\ncomputed. Comparisons of these sums to that of the central rectangle determine\nthe feature, similarly to LBP (See `LBP <plot_local_binary_pattern.html>`_).\n\nFirst, we generate an image to illustrate the functioning of MB-LBP: consider\na (9, 9) rectangle and divide it into (3, 3) block, upon which we then apply\nMB-LBP.\n\n\n"
