## Swift
* Swift runs as fast as C in numerical computation, and it doesnâ€™t have memory safety issues, and it is much easier to learn. If you need specific functionality, but it is not implemented in Swift yet, you can import corresponding Python, C or C++ package. 
* MacOS, iOS & Ubuntu
* [Get started with Swift from the REPL](https://swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-repl)
* Interoperable with python -> https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/PythonInteroperability.md
* Run in Jupyter -> https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter
