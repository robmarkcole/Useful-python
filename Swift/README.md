## Swift
* Swift runs as fast as C in numerical computation, and it doesn’t have memory safety issues, and it is much easier to learn. If you need specific functionality, but it is not implemented in Swift yet, you can import corresponding Python, C or C++ package. 
* MacOS, iOS & Ubuntu
* [Get started with Swift from the REPL](https://swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-repl)
* Interoperable with python -> https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/PythonInteroperability.md
* Run in Jupyter -> https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter
* [Swift Development with Visual Studio Code](https://nshipster.com/vscode/)

## Swift & Jupyter
* https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter -> Jupyter kernel, Ubuntu oriented, use Docker on Mac 
* [https://github.com/KelvinJin/iSwift](another kernel)
* [https://github.com/rayh/iSwift](and another Kernel) -> `docker run -t -i -p 8888:8888 --privileged rayh/swift-notebook`
