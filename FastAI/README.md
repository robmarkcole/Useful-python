## Fast.ai 
* https://github.com/fastai
* Current iteration of course is v4 using fastai2 https://course.fast.ai/
* Not supported on Mac (read the docs). Did run some of the examples but training was going to take hours on the Mac CPU vs minutes on a GPU, so Mac is not feasible.

## Ecosystem
* Visual UI adds a graphical interface to fastai allowing the user to quickly load, choose parameters, train and view results without the need to dig deep into the code -> https://github.com/asvcode/Vision_UI
* Equivalent to Tensorflow serving but simpler -> https://github.com/developmentseed/fastai-serving
