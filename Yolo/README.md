* https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
* https://blog.roboflow.ai/retail-store-item-detection-using-yolov5/
* YOLOv5 vs v4, comparable mean Average Precision ([mAP](https://forums.fast.ai/t/mean-average-precision-map/14345)) and faster inferences. Pytorch!
* pip installable: https://github.com/fcakyon/yolov5-pip

## Yolo V4

## Yolo (V3)
* https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
* Python wrapper -> https://github.com/madhawav/YOLO3-4-Py (first `xcode-select --install`) -> Getting error `Library not loaded: libdarknet.so`

##Â Tiny YOLOv3
We have a very small model as well for constrained environments, yolov3-tiny.

## Yolo with openCV
* [Call Yolo from CopenCV]()

## Yolo on pi
* Using pjreddie version (including yolov3-tiny) I hit [this issue](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/823) - recommended to use [AlexeyAB version](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)

## Yolo on Jetson Nano

## Yolo face

## Yolo vs others

```
    If I know I need to detect small objects and speed is not a concern, I tend to use Faster R-CNN.
    If speed is absolutely paramount, I use YOLO.
    If I need a middle ground, I tend to go with SSDs.
